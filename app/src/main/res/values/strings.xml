    <string name="game_rules" formatted="false"><b>Main goal:</b>
        Jack of Clubs is the one card that you shall avoid at all costs!
        If Jack is the one card that comes up when you press the \"PLAY\" button, you lose.
        You can either use the \"DEFEND\" button to knock Jack unconscious and win this way
        or you can use the \"PASS\" button and win by having Jack being the last card.\n
        \nBut you need to be strategic! You can only use \"DEFEND\" once per three turns and
        \"PASS\" every second turn. Luckily, I am a nice guy and decided to implement an
        animation that warns you when Jack is approaching. But I suck a precisionâ€¦
        Jack might be the first, second, third, fourth or fifth card.\n

        \n<b>Four of Clubs:</b>
        \nFour of Clubs is a scary one. If you encounter this card the Four of Clubs will
        duplicate Jack of Clubs and all of a sudden you will have to defend yourself
        against two Jacks instead of one! But, \"double the pain - double the gain\" right?\n

        \n<b>Queen of Hearts:</b>
        \nIf you play the Queen of Hearts card she will protect you the next time you
        accidentally play Jack of Clubs. Using her lovely charm and beautiful smile
        she distracts Jack and shuffles him back into the remaining deck.
        Love conquers all! \n

        \n<b>King of Spades:</b>
        \nThe King of Spades is allied with Jack of Clubs. Their teamwork paid off and
        they managed to erase the Queen of Hearts from both the history books and this game.
        If you already have the Queen of Hearts by your side, they unfortunately manage
        to kill her without you having any chance to prevent them.
